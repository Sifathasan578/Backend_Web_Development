// Pre Notes: 

Quiz question! … … … problem 
Got it ✅ Let’s go through each of these briefly but clearly, with examples so you can grasp them easily.

1. What is Inheritance
Inheritance is a mechanism where one class (child/subclass) acquires the properties and behaviors (fields and methods) of another class (parent/superclass).
👉 Example:
class Animal {
    void eat() { System.out.println("Eating..."); }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() { System.out.println("Barking..."); }
}

Here, Dog inherits eat() from Animal.

2. Superclass and Subclass
Superclass (Parent class): The class whose properties are inherited.


Subclass (Child class): The class that inherits from the superclass.


👉 Example:
class Vehicle { }   // Superclass
class Car extends Vehicle { } // Subclass


3. Why Use Inheritance
Reusability of code.


Cleaner, modular design.


Easier to maintain and extend.


👉 Example:
 Instead of writing eat() in Dog, Cat, Cow, we write it once in Animal.

4. Implementing Inheritance in Java
We use the extends keyword.
👉 Example:
class Parent {
    void display() { System.out.println("Hello from Parent"); }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    void show() { System.out.println("Hello from Child"); }
}


5. The Java Platform Class Hierarchy
At the top of Java’s hierarchy is the Object class. Every class implicitly extends Object.
 So all classes have methods like toString(), equals(), hashCode().
👉 Example:
class MyClass { } // actually extends Object by default


6. Types of Inheritance
Single Inheritance


Multiple Inheritance (not allowed directly with classes)


Multi-level Inheritance


Hierarchical Inheritance


Hybrid Inheritance



7. Single Inheritance
One class inherits from one class.
👉 Example:
class A { }
class B extends A { }


8. Multiple Inheritance
A class inherits from more than one class.
 👉 Not supported with classes in Java (to avoid ambiguity), but possible with interfaces.
interface A { void methodA(); }
interface B { void methodB(); }

class C implements A, B {
    public void methodA() { System.out.println("A"); }
    public void methodB() { System.out.println("B"); }
}


9. Multi-level Inheritance
Inheritance across multiple levels.
👉 Example:
class A { }
class B extends A { }
class C extends B { }


10. Hierarchical Inheritance
Multiple classes inherit from the same parent.
👉 Example:
class Animal { }
class Dog extends Animal { }
class Cat extends Animal { }


11. Hybrid Inheritance
Combination of multiple types (like multi-level + hierarchical).
 👉 Java does not support hybrid inheritance with classes, but you can achieve it with interfaces.

12. Multiple inheritance with classes is NOT permitted in Java
If Java allowed this:
class A { void show() { System.out.println("A"); } }
class B { void show() { System.out.println("B"); } }
class C extends A, B { } // ❌ Error

👉 This would cause ambiguity. That’s why interfaces are used instead.

13. Private Members in a Superclass
Private members are not inherited directly. They are only accessible within the superclass.
 But subclasses can access them via public/protected getters/setters.
👉 Example:
class Parent {
    private int value = 10;
    public int getValue() { return value; }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    void print() {
        // System.out.println(value); // ❌ Not allowed
        System.out.println(getValue()); // ✅ Allowed
    }
}


14. Type Casting in Java
Upcasting: Casting subclass to superclass (safe, implicit).


Downcasting: Casting superclass to subclass (explicit, can cause ClassCastException).


👉 Example:
class Animal { }
class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() { System.out.println("Bark!"); }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal a = new Dog(); // Upcasting
        // a.bark(); ❌ Not accessible

        Dog d = (Dog) a; // Downcasting
        d.bark();        // ✅ Bark!
    }
}


Do you want me to also draw a diagram of the types of inheritance in Java so you can visualize it more clearly?

Live: 

default = package private 

equals() 
hashCode() 

fully qualified name 

packagename.classname

toString: 

OOP diamond problem! 

Type casting 

dynamic method dispatch = polymorphism 

explicit type casting 
implicit type casting 

Upcasting 

Parent b = new Child();

Downcasting 
Upcasting 

factory method design pattern 

super 
super() 

this 
this() 

SDLC 
SOLID
