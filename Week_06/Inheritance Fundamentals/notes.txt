java platform class hierarchy: 
all classes extends object class, provides: toString(), equals(), hashCode()

Types: 
Single Inheritance
1 class 1 child 
Multiple Inheritance 
child inherits from multiple parent (java doesn’t support it)
Multi-level Inheritance
C extends B extends A, level kom better
Hierarchical Inheritance, common
B, C, D extends A
Hybrid Inheritance 
Multi-level + Hierarchical 
or any other combinal … … 

Multiple inheritance with classes is not permitted in java 

diamond structure
B, C extends from A
D extends from B, C

solves with an interface where you can implement two classes!

Type casting in java: 
Upcasting Implicit Casting 
Downcasting Explicit Casting 

child = new child lekha jay
child = new parent lekha jay 
parent = new child lekha jabe nah 

➤ Upcasting (For polymorphism!)/ Is a relationship
Converting a child class reference into a parent class reference.
Happens automatically (implicit).
It’s safe, because every child is-a parent.
➤ Downcasting
Converting a parent class reference back into a child class reference.
Must be done manually (explicit cast).
It’s risky, because not every parent is a child.
If done incorrectly → ClassCastException at runtime.
