// Question: 

Perfect, Sifat ✅

You’ve completed the **“Inheritance Fundamentals”** chapter — which covers everything from basic inheritance, types of inheritance, `extends`, `super`, private member access, to upcasting and downcasting.

To **truly evaluate** whether you’ve mastered this chapter and are ready to move on to *Polymorphism*, here’s a single **comprehensive coding problem** that integrates *all key inheritance concepts* from your PDF.

## 🧩 **Comprehensive Practice Problem — “University Management System”**

### 🎯 **Objective:**

Design a Java program that demonstrates **single, multi-level, hierarchical inheritance**, **access modifiers**, and **upcasting/downcasting** concepts — all within one problem.

---

### 🏫 **Scenario:**

You are asked to build a small *University Management System* using OOP and inheritance principles.

---

### 🔹 **Class Hierarchy:**

1. **Class: Person (Superclass)**

   * **Private fields:** `name`, `age`
   * **Public methods:**

     * Constructor to initialize the fields.
     * `displayInfo()` → prints name and age.
   * Use proper encapsulation (getters/setters if needed).

2. **Class: Employee (extends Person)**

   * **Protected field:** `salary`
   * **Method:** `displayInfo()` (override the parent method to include salary).
   * **Method:** `work()` → prints `"Employee is working."`

3. **Class: Teacher (extends Employee)**

   * **Field:** `subject`
   * **Constructor:** Calls `super()` and initializes subject.
   * **Method:** `displayInfo()` → override again to include subject.
   * **Method:** `teach()` → prints `"Teaching <subject>"`

4. **Class: Admin (extends Employee)**

   * **Field:** `department`
   * **Method:** `manage()` → prints `"Managing <department> department."`

5. **Class: Student (extends Person)**

   * **Private field:** `cgpa`
   * **Constructor:** Initializes all attributes.
   * **Method:** `displayInfo()` → overrides to show student info.
   * **Method:** `study()` → prints `"Student <name> is studying."`

### 🧠 **Additional Requirements:**

1. Demonstrate **single inheritance** (`Person → Student`).
2. Demonstrate **multi-level inheritance** (`Person → Employee → Teacher`).
3. Demonstrate **hierarchical inheritance** (`Employee → Teacher` and `Employee → Admin`).
4. Demonstrate **upcasting**:

   ```java
   Person p = new Teacher("Sifat", 26, 50000, "OOP");
   p.displayInfo(); // Should call Teacher’s version
   ```
5. Demonstrate **downcasting**:

   ```java
   Teacher t = (Teacher) p;
   t.teach();
   ```
6. Show that **private members of Person** cannot be accessed directly in child classes.
7. Use the **super keyword** in constructors to initialize parent fields.

---

### 💡 **Expected Output Example (depends on your print style):**

```
--- Upcasting Demo ---
Name: Sifat
Age: 26
Salary: 50000.0
Subject: OOP

--- Downcasting Demo ---
Teaching OOP

--- Hierarchical Demo ---
Managing Administration department.
Student Rahim is studying.

--- Private Access Demo ---
Cannot access private field 'name' directly from subclass.
```

### 🧾 **Evaluation Criteria (When You Submit Your Solution):**

| Concept                    | Weight | What I’ll Check                             |
| -------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Inheritance structure      | 20%    | Proper class hierarchy (`extends`, `super`) |
| Encapsulation              | 10%    | Use of private/protected fields and getters |
| Method overriding          | 15%    | Correct use of `@Override`                  |
| Upcasting & Downcasting    | 20%    | Demonstrated correctly                      |
| Multi-level + Hierarchical | 15%    | Both structures implemented                 |
| Access control             | 10%    | Correct handling of private/protected       |
| Code readability           | 10%    | Clean formatting and naming                 |
