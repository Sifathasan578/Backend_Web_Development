Factory Method Pattern 

Abstraction/ Interface

poly + morph

Collections Framework: 
List
ArrayList 
Hashmap
List vs ArrayList: ArrayList list k extend kore, List parent, ArrayList child 

return type matter kore override er shomoy 

concurrent framework

Upcasting: Child -> Parent
Downcasting: Parent -> Child, Explicit 

Java compile time ei PARSE korte pari oi particular class e ki ki ache or nei! 

ArrayList: Concrete 
List: Contract ?

Another name of interface is contract

Types of Polymorphism: 
Static or Compile-time polymorphism: Method Overloading
Dynamic or runtime polymorphism: Method Overriding 

Static Polymorphism: 
shudhu compile time ei kaaz hoy
…
…

same method name + different parameters (count, different type)
overloading e return type change hoy, overriding er khetre hoy nah 

Dynamic Polimorphism: 
runtime 
method overriding 
inheritance: suparclass -> subclass 
upcasting and dynamic method dispatch 

Example: already practiced

## BroCode:: 

Abstraction in OOP
Hiding implementation details and showing only essential features 
Abstract classes can’t be instantiated directly 
Can contain abstract methods, must be implemented 
Can contain concrete methods which are inherited 

concrete?

abstract class can have abstract methods which can be implemented by children classes! 

Interfaces: 

A blueprint for a class that specifies a set of abstract methods that implementing a classes must define
Support multiple inheritance like behavior 

Polymorphism: 

poly: 
morph:

Objects can identify as other objects 
Objects can be treated as objects of a common superclass 

polymorphism can also work with interfaces

Runtime polymorphism/ Dynamic polymorphism
when the method that gets executed is decided at runtime based on the actual type of the object.
