Choosing the right collection in java 
When to use map vs set 

Collection Framework:
interfaces provide kore
interface contract rakhe then pore implement kore 
jemon list interface, arraylist implementation of list 
collection: object represents group of objects 
collection framework: set of classes and interfaces … store, manipulate, and access groups of objects efficiently  

Core interfaces: List, Set, Map
Core classes: ArrayList, HashSet, HashMap, LinkedList 

set = unique elements thake
map = dictionary = key, value pair

list kono data structure er moddhe pore? 
dynamic array. size unmentioned. like vectors. 

Benefits: 
reduce programming effort 
increases performance 
provides interoperability 
reduces the effort required to learn APIs 
reduces the effort required to design and implement APIs
foster software reuse 

Traversing collections: 
Aggregate operations (Streams)
after jdk 8
use streams + lambda expressions 
non-mutative 
… parallelized for performance 
example for later 
For each construct 
easy to read 
cannot remove elements inside loop 
Iterators 
step through elements one by one 
methods: 
hasNext()
next() 
remove()

for(Iterable<String> it = list.iterator(); it.hasNext();) {
            if(it.next().isEmpty()) {
                it.remove(); // safe removal 
            }
        }

shob shomoy check kore porer ghorer jonno. ejonno safe case. 
iterator rarely kaze lage

collection interface bulk operations: 
containall
addAll 
removeAll
…  … 

List interface: 
ordered 
duplicates allowed 
indexed access 
dynamic size 
ArrayList, LinkedList, Stack, Vector 
ArrayList: 
implements list, extends collection 
…
…

class implements interface 
interface extends interface

add(1, element): ektu costly
add(ele); easy O(1), last e boshay
